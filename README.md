Hypothesis Testing for Autolib electric car-sharing service company
=======
This analysis demonstrates the hypothesis testing process on a data science project.

Some of the techniques discussed include univariate and bivariate data analysis, sampling approach, null and alternate hypotheses as well as test statistics.
Project Description
-----------
We have been tasked to understand electric car usag. We will work as a Data Scientist for the Autolib electric car-sharing service company to investigate a claim about the blue cars from the provided Autolib dataset.

In an effort to do this, we need to identify some areas and periods of interest via sampling stating the reason to the choice of method, then perform hypothesis testing with regards to the claim that we will have made.

# Hypothesis Testing #
Null Hypothesis: For both Paris and Essonne the average number of blue cars picked up during weekends is the same.

Ho : μ1 = μ2 (where μ1 is the mean for Paris and μ2 is the mean for Essonne)

Alternate Hypothesis: The average number of blue cars picked up during the weekend is not the same for Paris and Essonne.

Ha : μ1 ≠ μ2

# Data Description #
The provided dataset is a daily aggregation, by date and postal code, of the number of events on the Autolib network (car-sharing and recharging). The dataset and glossary to use for this project can be found here [https://bit.ly/DSCoreAutolibDataset
